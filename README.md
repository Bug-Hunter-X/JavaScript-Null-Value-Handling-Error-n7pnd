This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript involving improper handling of null values. The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version. The error occurs because the code does not explicitly check for null values, leading to incorrect calculations or runtime errors. The solution adds a check for null values to prevent these issues. The README provides a detailed explanation of the bug and its solution.
